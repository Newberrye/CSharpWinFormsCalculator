# CSharpWinFormsCalculator
This is my Calculator app that I created for a quick dive into WinForms. In this project I explore WinForm interface item creation, interlinking interface items, creating event handlers for those items, and executing code when those events are made.

## Calculator Project 
### Completed
1. Create interface on WinForms.
2. Create Event Handlers for button clicks.
3. Create code to input button presses into input box.
4. Add Calculating ability.
5. Add error check handling



### Todo
1. Fix error for multiple operations.
2. Add functionality for keyboard presses to function as button presses.
3. Fix order of operations.
