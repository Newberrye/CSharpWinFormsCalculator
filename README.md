# CSharpWinFormsCalculator
This is my Calculator app that I created for a quick dive into WinForms. In this project I explore WinForm interface item creation, interlinking interface items, creating event handlers for those items, and executing code when those events are made.

## Calculator Project 
### Completed
1. Create interface on WinForms.
2. Create Event Handlers for button clicks.
3. Create code to input button presses into input box.


### Todo
1. Add Calculating ability.
2. Add error handling, such as: Divide by Zero, Operator mashing, entering an operator first, etc.
3. Add functionality for keyboard presses to function as button presses.
